# RedstarOSxfce
Redstar OS theme for xfce
Porting of the Redstar OS 3 icon set to xfce. Yup the North korean one! I saw someone had extracted the icons but had not ported them, this should work fine for xfce4. 

Natrually this isn't *software* from Redstar OS so its free from any spyware or concerns of such, its just the icon themes ported over.
